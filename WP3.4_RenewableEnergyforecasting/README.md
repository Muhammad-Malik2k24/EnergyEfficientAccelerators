## Overview
This repository provides code and corresponding documentation for Machine Learning models for forecasting the power production of solar power plant. 

## Structure
- `data/`: Raw and processed data, and optimal ESS capcacity results.
- `docs/`: Documentation on methodology, results, and references.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model selection, model training & evaluation, hyperparameter_tuning, main file for running and logging experiments.
- `models/`: Pytorch/Tensorflow implementaion of selected machine learning models.


## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the data preprocessing script: `python scripts/main.py`.
